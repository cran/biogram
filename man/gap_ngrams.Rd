\title{Gap n-grams}
\usage{
gap_ngrams(ngrams)
}
\arguments{
\item{ngrams}{a vector of positioned n-grams (as created by \code{\link{count_ngrams}}).}
}
\value{
A \code{character} vector of (n-1)-grams with introduced gaps.
}
\description{
Introduces gaps in the n-grams.
}
\details{
A single element of the input n-gram at a time will be replaced 
by a gap. For example, introducing gaps in n-gram \code{2_1.1.2_0.1} 
will results in three n-grams: \code{3_1.2_1} (where the \code{2_1_0} unigram 
was replaced by a gap), \code{2_1.2_2} and \code{2_1.1_0}.
}
\examples{
gap_ngrams(c("2_1.1.2_0.1", "3_1.1.2_0.0", "3_2.2.2_0.0"))
gap_ngrams(c("1.1.2_0.1", "1.1.2_0.0", "2.2.2_0.0"))
}
