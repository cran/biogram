\title{Create feature according to given contingency matrix}
\usage{
create_feature_target(n11, n01, n10, n00)
}
\arguments{
\item{n11}{number of elements for which both target and feature equal 1.}

\item{n01}{number of elements for which target and feature equal 1,0 
respectively.}

\item{n10}{number of elements for which target and feature equal 0,1 
respectively.}

\item{n00}{number of elements for which both target and feature equal 0.}
}
\value{
a matrix of 2 columns and n11+n10+n01+n00 rows. Columns represent
target and feature vectors, respectively.
}
\description{
Creates a matrix of features and target based on the values from contingency matrix.
