\title{Calculate encoding distance}
\usage{
calc_ed(a, b, prop = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{a}{encoding (see \code{\link{validate_encoding}} for more information 
about the required structure of encoding).}

\item{b}{encoding to which \code{a} should be compared. Must have equal number 
of groups or less than \code{a}. Both \code{a} and {b} must have the the same 
number of elements.}

\item{prop}{\code{matrix} of physicochemical properties to normalize the 
encoding distance.  Must have either four or 20 columns and each column should 
represent properties of the single amino acid/nucleotide. If \code{NULL},
encoding distance is not normalized.}
}
\value{
an encoding distance.
}
\description{
Computes the encoding distance between two encodings.
}
\details{
The encoding distance between \code{a} and \code{b} is defined as the 
minimum number of amino acids that have to be moved between subgroups of encoding 
to make \code{a} identical to \code{b} (order of subgroups in the encoding and amino 
acids in a group is unimportant).

If the parameter \code{prop} is supplied, the encoding distance is normalized by the 
factor equal to the sum of distances for each group in \code{a} and the closest group 
in \code{b}. The position of a group is defined as the mean value of properties of 
amino acids or nucleotides belonging the group.

See the package vignette for more details.
